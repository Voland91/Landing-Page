This project was a recruitment task in some software house.

I've made it based on delivered graphic project (Adobe XD).
I had chance to use SCSS preprocessor, BEM methodology, RWD.
I've also used some JS, not much, just for burger menu and to set Swiper (https://swiperjs.com/). BTW it was my first contact with Swiper so there were some conflicts between us but in the end it works fine :)
